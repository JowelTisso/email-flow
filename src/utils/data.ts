    Hi Future Blink,

    I was checking Future Blink & found that you guys are looking to add Frontend Developer related expertise in your team.

    I was curious to know if you guys would consider an external agency for the same?

    I have 2 years of experience in Frontend development


    We are currently helping clients for the same.

    Would you like to connect and discuss the possibilities?
